#Browser Example

This example uses Sandeep Mistry's noble library for node.js to create a central server that reads and connects to BLE peripherals and sends this info to a browser with socket.io

It displays the peripherals found and its UUIDs. You can click the peripherals list to connect and get updated RSSI values.
